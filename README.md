# City-View-2D

## Introduction
It’s a Scenario base 2D project. A city scenario with lake and ship. According to time, the light will change from day to night. Sun will rise and set. In addition, the weather will change like in summer the scenario will be sunny and birds will fly in the sky. In rainy season there will be rain. Birds will fly in sky and fish can be seen in lakes. There can be also seen rainbow after the rain. There will also four lane road in this project. Different type of Transports can be seen in this road. Plane and Helicopter will fly. There are also some features that can be control by keyboard and mouse handler.
## Background Study
This project implementation uses a set of OpenGL functions and API’s which helps to draw on screen. This is a standard specification defining a cross language across platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics. OpenGL was developed by silicon graphics Inc. in 1992. It is widely used in CAD, VR and flight simulation and also in video games.
OpenGL serves two main purpose:
•	To hide the complexities of interfacing with different 3D accelerators, by presenting programmer with a single, uniform API
•	To hide the differing capabilities of hardware platforms, by requiring that all Implementations support the full OpenGL, feature set. OpenGL is an application program interface (API) offering various functions to implement primitives, models and images. This offer functions to create and manipulate render lighting, coloring, viewing the models. OpenGL offers different coordinate system and frames. OpenGL offers translation, rotation and scaling of objects.


Most of our applications will be designed to access OpenGL directly through functions in three libraries. They are:
•	Main GL: Library has names that begin with the letter gland are stored in a library usually referred to as GL.
•	OpenGL Utility Library (GLU): This library uses only GL functions but contains code for creating common objects and simplifying viewing. All functions in GLU can be created from the core GL library but application programmers prefer not to write the code repeatedly. The GLU library is available in all OpenGL implementations. Functions in the GLU library begins with the letters glu.
•	OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT): This provides the minimum functionality that should be accepted in any modern windowing system. For the X window system, this library is called GLX, for windows, it is WGL or Wiggle. And for Macintosh, it is AGL. Rather than using different library for each system, we use a readily available library called GLUT.

## System Implementation Method
 We have used different resources to develop the project. These are:
•	Code Blocks
•	Computer
•	OpenGL primitives
•	Online resources
Objectives

## Conclusion and Future Implement:

We have attempted to design and implement “A city view” in 2D. OpenGL supports enormous flexibility in the design and the use of OpenGL graphics programs. The presence of many built-in classis’s methods takes care of much functionality and reduce the job of coding as well as makes the implementation simpler. In future implementation, we can add traffic system, human walkway, car parking system, flyover, foot over system, ghat and so many.
